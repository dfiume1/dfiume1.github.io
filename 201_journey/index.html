            <img src = "images/journey.jpg">
            <p>This summer, my two roommates Brendan, Poom and I have decided to enjoy our fleeting youth and lack of responsibilities by driving to Seattle and back. While I’m not sure exactly when the idea came about, there was a time where we didn’t know if Poom was going to be in the U.S., so we would take the opportunity to see the country together. We’ll largely be camping, as well as staying with friends and family (thank you!!!!). We acknowledge that we’re very privileged to be able to do something like this, and we plan on doing some good along the way. We'll have more to say on this, but for now it is important to note that many of the national parks are unable to sustain their visitors as well as occupying stolen land. From environmental, photographic, and respectful perspectives, we aim to hold ourselves to a higher standard.<p>
            <p>You’ll get updates from us here, as well as some stats, oddities, stories, and some photos along the way. Largely, this is a good way to let our friends/family know we're still alive. My photography (some digital, some color film) from this trip will be available somewhere at some point, the photos with the blog will likely be shot on iPhone </p>

            Yes and yes. I made it from scratch the day before we left (and I don't make websites) - it might get better, it might not. Graphic design is not our passion.

          <h2>Appalachia</h2>
          <img src = "images/app.jpg">
          <p> We left “my” house at precisely 9.15am on June 5, 2024 to begin our cross-country roadtrip. Within the first hour of the drive, we managed to spot a Cybertruck and a “Legotruck” in the wild. We were fortunate enough to be joined by two friends currently based out of the DMV area (not to be confused with the Department of Motor Vehicles) as we explored Luray Caverns – supposedly the largest cave system east of the Appalachians. </p>
          <p>We stretched our imaginations trying to match the stalactite and stalagmites to shapes we knew. I also unsuccessfully tried to identify some of the host rocks surrounding the limestone formations. What I have been doing these past four years I will never know. We then went for lunch at a cat-themed cafe before bidding farewell to our friends in the DMV. </p>
          <p>The Dodge Journey then had its first mountain road test as we climbed the Blue Ridge Mountains to our first national park on this trip – Shenandoah. We then drove on Skyline Drive, making sure to stop at overlooks along the way. The intermittent rain of the day added fog to the sides of the mountains, adding an atmosphere of mystique. We then hiked along part of the Appalachian Trail (AT) – perhaps the world’s longest walking trail – to get to a granite overlook we had seen on Skyline Drive. We then attempted to hike down to Whiteoak Falls on the Robinson River but the humidity got to us. We made it to the pool at the top of the falls before deciding to turn back, but not before we were rewarded with an amazing view of the southeast and of the waterfall itself.</p>
          <p>We then camped at the biggest campground either of us had ever been to, complete with all luxuries such as flushing bathrooms, showers (!!), and even laundry services. As it was the first day of camping, Dan and I wanted to test how bad we would smell after camping so we did not use any of those services. Our campsite was small but had everything we needed. We experienced strong winds throughout the night, but our tent withstood the winds without much issue. We spent almost half an hour figuring out every component of setting up the tent, a figure which we weren’t too satisfied about.</p>
          <p>During our drive on Skyline Drive, we managed to spot a few deer on the side of the road. We appreciated being able to see them from afar, but we wondered how the construction of the drive had affected their behavior. </p>
          <p>The next day, we drove from Shenandoah to the Smokies. As Dan drove for most of the previous day, I instead took the wheel for most of the drive. We stopped at a cafe next to Roanoke College to sort out Poom’s remaining commitments, including his housing situation, then stopped at a drive-in in the next town over. It was my first experience at a drive-in, and I was sure that anyone else there would have been able to tell because I needed Dan to guide me through the process. We would pull into a parking spot, wait for an attendant to take our order from the comforts of our car, and then have the food delivered to us. I had the world’s reddest hotdog (apparently), which was good. We then drove to our campground, but not before we struggled with finding the cheapest gas prices around in eastern TN. The cheapest we found was $2.74/gallon (26.66 baht/liter for my Thai friends). The gas station was next to a Walmart parking lot, which was occupied by a replica of a Confererate-era submarine, complete with flags from the era… We then stopped at an apple orchard and grabbed some apples, in hopes that we maintain good health for the rest of the journey and keep the doctors away for a bit (well, I might become one in the future but I digress)</p>
          <p>Our campsite in the Smokies was a nice, secluded campsite by a creek. At all campsites, we take great care in making sure that all of our trash is properly disposed of, especially food items. We have taken great care in ensuring that bears won’t be able to access our food during our stay. Once we were situated, we went on a hike to a waterfall in hopes of cooling down (and maybe swim). We hiked to Hen Wallow Falls and enjoyed walking over the log bridges across streams and admired the lush scenery along the trail. We then returned to camp to attempt to cook pasta. The stove gave us an as-of-now unsolved issue, but we managed to test out the setup and made pretty good pasta. We then cleaned up the cooking scene before retiring for the night. </p>
          <p>Our day in the Smokies itself was filled with the constant rattling of my kettle, much to Dan’s chagrin. Once we had packed up camp and driven to our first trail however, such chagrin evaporated. We followed Dan’s mom’s recommendations for hiking and had an enjoyable hike up to Chimney Top Overlook (the trail beyond was closed due to a recent fire, something which did not deter some). The trail was STEEP in certain sections, taking me back to the one HIIT class I showed up to at Brown but the view was worth it. We then followed the horde of people to Clingman’s Dome – the highest point of the Smokies, where we briefly entered into North Carolina and sat in 45 minutes of parking lot traffic with a BEAUTIFUL view to our left. We again briefly hiked the AT and crossed back and forth between Tennessee and North Carolina. Throngs of people were doing the same hike, including a pretty smart fellow who tried to defy gravity by walking backward uphill. We then drove to another over vista point and spotted (hitch)hikers. We unfortunately could not assist them but wish them the best of luck in their own journeys. We then grabbed free, freshly made glazed donuts as we left the park on National Donut Day. Our drive to Nashville was uneventful, save for a stop at Buc-ee’s. The place is MASSIVE! We then ended the day at Dan’s aunt’s house, who generously prepared pizza for all of us and offered to host us for two nights. That concludes our adventures in Appalachia. Stay tuned for more updates!

            <h2>Nashville</h2>
            <img src = "images/dj.jpg">
            <p>Hi all! It’s Dan, with some general additions before I get into our fun weekend in Nashville. The first half of the trip is just Poom and I - Brendan will be joining us in Seattle - he has been contributing with music recs thankfully (we need more! Let us know!) As for this website, it will slowly get better (we have images and links now, woo!) Will I ever fix the fact that you have to click one of the entries on the sidebar for the website to work as intended? Maybe! For those in my family asking to comment - this isn’t social media, but feel free to email/text communicate with us in any way you know us from! You’ll also be getting some numerical updates from me - and eventually a box-score esque table on the end of each post. If you have anything we should count or keep track of, let us know! Always nice to have something to do while driving.</p>
            <p> As Poom mentioned, my Aunt graciously hosted us during our stay in Nashville. We slept in while we were there - people who know me know that waking up at 6-7am while we had been camping was going to catch up to me. We were spoiled with great food, people, and my Aunt’s two lovely dogs (although maybe not as spoiled as her dogs, they’re the royalty in that house). We hiked a total of 16.5 miles during our time in Appalachia, with a total elevation gain of 3560 ft. We didn’t slow down though - we did 16,443 steps walking around Nashville, more than any other day except our first day of the trip. </p>
            <p>We started our afternoon in Nashville at their main park, Centennial Park. There was a free concert series happening where we stopped by and heard a few songs from The Watson Twins. Live music is great - even country. The big attraction in Centennial Park is Nashville’s full scale replica of the Parthenon. It is impressive and now home to a small museum we visited with a great exhibit on repatriation - see <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/27/opinion/nashville-museum-artifacts-mexico.html">this NYT article</a>. Small may be the wrong word as on the second floor, occupying the rest of the Parthenon, is a 42 ft replica of the Athena Parthenon. It’s the tallest indoor statue in the western hemisphere, and the small statue of Nike in Athena’s hand is taller than I am at 6 '4". All the Percy Jackson reading as a kid finally paid off I guess. </p>
            <img src = "images/athena.jpg">
            <p>We then made our way downtown, walking past Vanderbilt’s under construction athletic facilities on the way - an awful lot of football field construction for a not very good football team. Food wise we had to try the Nashville favorite - hot chicken. We got this spicy, crispier variant of fried chicken at the southern equivalent of Quincy Market for the pvd/Boston folks. Poom was impressed by my spice tolerance, apparently after a year of eating his curry I have developed some ability to eat spicy food. After walking around downtown and Broadway for a bit, we stopped for a milkshake at the Legendary Milkshake Bar - and I was not disappointed. We shared (yes, they’re that big) a cookie dough concoction of epic proportions. </p>
            <p>Although very touristy, we decided to head back to Broadway and go in and out of the bars, listening to all the great live music along the way. Everyone was good - especially the supporting band members - they were definitely some of the best drummers/bassists/etc I had heard live. Most impressive was how long they were on for, as one of the groups was playing about 14 hours of shows within a 24 hour period. We briefly met some people, but it shouldn’t surprise anyone that the only person I was talking to was a photographer. Overall, it was a very fun night, and it was great as always to see my aunt and uncle - now the trip out west begins! </p>

          <div id="Driving West" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>Driving West</h2>
            <img src = "images/west.jpg">
            <p>Howdy! Poom and Dan back here again with our latest blog entry. This time, we are rapidly traveling west in a bid to reach the mountains out west. However, that does not mean that we are simply leaving the locations between in a blur. Far from it! During our drive west to Santa Fe, we made sure to stop in each state we passed through – Tennessee (well, the Western Division of Tennessee), Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The following outlines our experiences in each locale. Furthermore, to keep our minds somewhat stimulated during the drive through what can sometimes be pejoratively referred to as “flyover states,” we have decided to play the classic road trip game of “spot a license plate from each state.” But since you have to look at every license plate anyway…they’re in a spreadsheet. We both just took a data visualization class - we couldn’t help ourselves. Stay tuned for the results of our spontaneous I-40 license plate sample!</p>
            <h3>TN</h3>
            <p>Our first stop was to try out some Memphis BBQ. Or rather pick it up to bring to our very kind friends who were hosting us in Little Rock. We ended up taking our first big wrong turn of the trip and took a detour through the city - no complaints from us, it was a nice drive. The place was on Elvis Presley Blvd, so we played Elvis for the rest of the drive to Little Rock. We also drove by the Bass Pro Shop pyramid on the way out of town - it is crazy that it's up there in the largest pyramids in the world. The BBQ was absolutely fantastic by the way, definitely one of the best things we’ve eaten on the trip so far. </p>
            <h3>AR</h3>
            <img src = "images/AR.jpg">
            <p>After eating bbq with our new friends, they taught us how to play Golf - the card game. Beginner’s luck definitely carried Poom, for he won basically every round. We also got to see their two wonderful cats – Willow and (?) before retiring to bed.</p>
            <p>Following our new friends’ advice, we hiked Pinnacle Mountain close to Little Rock. We had fun scrambling up the boulder fields on the eastern face of the mountain before being rewarded with an amazing view up top of the mountain - may have been the best hike on the trip! Who knew we would find such big rocks in Little Rock. We then went to a breakfast place, which Little Rock has a lot of good ones, and had great eggs benedict. </p>
            <h3>OK</h3>
            <p>Our time in Oklahoma was rather short but it was very sweet! We first entered the state on the eastern side, which had been set aside as the homeland for many Native American tribes evicted from their homeland as a result of Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Act. During the drive, we learned that the tribal governments have the authority to issue their own license plates. </p>
            <p>The drive was mostly uneventful through what I presumed to be natural vegetation, interspersed with casinos operated by the native community. Dan considered stopping to gamble, but he was too sure of his chances of winning and too tired to deal with the IRS that we did not partake. We stopped at Naija Wife Restaurant in Oklahoma City, where we had amazing fried whole fish with jollof rice and amazing service to boot! We even got free samples of Nigerian soups while we waited for food, which we enjoyed dearly. We had trouble finding the restaurant at first, for it was in the basement of an office skyscraper. However, I would recommend it to anyone passing through OKC! We then walked in Bricktown, a redeveloped district of OKC with canals lined with shops and bars. Dan had some gelato, which he said was good but “not gelato”. We then trekked down to the banks of the Oklahoma River before driving back to our motel. We made plans for Utah and Idaho before going to sleep. The next day, we had a surprisingly good breakfast and got some free ice before leaving for Santa Fe. </p>
            <h3>TX</h3>
            <img src = "images/ranch.jpg">
            <p>Our time in Texas was even more brief than Oklahoma. We finally received contact with Brendan as we were driving past the wind turbines of the Texas Panhandle. We saw the Leaning Tower of Texas, a water tower leaning in the direction of the highway. We then stopped at a Waffle House before leaving the South behind, along with stopping at Cadillac Ranch – an art installation by … that features ten old Cadillacs buried head-first into the ground. Poom added another crime to his list by graffitiing part of the highway barrier (it was part of the art installation, allegedly). We then saw some impressive cuestas as we drove out of Texas’ panhandle.</p>
            <img src = "images/poom.jpg">
            <h3>NM</h3>
            <p>We stopped along Route 66 at the Route 66 car museum. It was a great stop and they had everything from an old model T, thunderbirds, and odd pickup trucks and vans. We then finished our drive out West and arrived in Santa Fe in the evening. Thus concludes our south state capitol tour - Nashville, Little Rock, Oklahoma City, and Santa Fe are all state capitals. The next state capital we will visit on this trip is Salt Lake City, UT - stay tuned! </p>
            <img src = "images/65.jpg">
            <h3>Preliminary/Qualitative I-40 license plate data:</h3>
            <p>All U-hauls are registered in AZ
              <br> There are common states trucks are licensed in - IN IL ME NE CA
              <br> TX likes their white cars
              <br> Soooo many people with temporary license plates!!
              <br> Even on this interstate, crossing state lines immediately changes the vast majority of vehicles to the home state. 
              <br> Saw a lot more fellow Marylanders than expected (3)
              <br> We imagine that state laws requiring when/if you have to change the license plate when you buy a used car matter.
              <br> Saw both Alaska and Hawaii - we think the hardest state to get is none other than Rhode Island. 
              <br> From Nashville to outside of OKC, we saw 710 vehicles. </p>

          <div id="Santa Fe" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>Santa Fe</h2>
            <img src = "images/SF.jpg">
            <p>We are in (New) Mexico! In case there was any confusion, we did not cross an international border. Now officially West, we arrived in Santa Fe for dinner. We had fantastic New Mexican-style enchiladas and stuffed sopapillas – a type of fried pastry common in the Spanish-speaking world. As we were ordering the dishes, we were asked the official state question of New Mexico: “Red or Green?” This is not a “go/no go” on spice, but instead refers to the type of New Mexican chile one prefers on their dish. Chiles hold a special place in New Mexican food tradition, as chile has been cultivated in New Mexico for quite some time and gives the cuisine a distinctive kick. Dan went for “Red,” as that is supposedly sweeter and is less reminiscent of the stereotypical “pepper” taste, a taste that Dan is not a fan of. Being as indecisive as ever, Poom went for “Christmas” – smothering the dish with both red and green peppers.
            </p><p>We then walked around downtown Santa Fe, but almost everything was closed by the time we got there. We had a great time marveling at the architecture of downtown Santa Fe – built to mimic the traditional Puebloan architecture common throughout the region. We then set up camp amongst ponderosa pines just east of Santa Fe in the Santa Fe National Forest. The campsite is only 15 minutes from downtown Santa Fe, but it was almost a world apart. During our stay, we came across two deer crossings and we did not get any cell service (not that we minded, of course). This was our first “dry campsite” (no water of any sort is available at the campsite), but the campsite was very clean and well-maintained. 
            </p><p>The next day, Poom was able to enjoy his 5-cent morning cup of joe (the cheapest instant coffee he could find) in the pine forest. According to Dan, Poom was “the happiest that he had seen.” (seriously, pure bliss) We then made our way to Los Alamos, and appropriately played the Oppenheimer soundtrack on the drive up there. Listening to “Can You Hear The Music” as we drove up the side of a canyon was an unforgettable experience. We walked around town a bit and visited a great museum about the Manhattan Project. It was a good experience and gave us time to think about the more global role of science. My (Dan) favorite part was that they had the 35mm camera that was used to photograph the Trinity Test. Poom attempted to commit yet another crime by attempting to enter a road that was owned by the laboratory (definitely wasn’t me navigating). 
            <img src = "images/LA.jpg">
            </p><p>We spontaneously decided to visit Bandelier National Monument since we were close. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that the national monument is the site of a pre-colonial settlement. The settlement is located in a canyon, whose walls are lined with tuff – a rock indicative of a volcanic eruption event. Unlike what the name suggests, tuff is actually not that tough of a rock. People have been able to carve out caverns within the rock and create living spaces shaded from the sun in many locations. Poom found the site to be slightly reminiscent of Cappadocia in Turkiye. We were able to walk around the pre colonial settlement and learned about their ways of life.  
            <img src = "images/band.jpg">
            </p><p>After that, we went back into Santa Fe to explore the Catholic cathedral (stunning) and Canyon Road, an art/sculpture district per the advice of a Santa Fe resident we met the day before. We then had more traditional Mexican burritos the next night at a food truck. Dan solidified his hatred for “Green,” saying that “it’s just heat with no redeeming flavor profile.” 
            </p><p>Our last adventure in Santa Fe was an unexpected one - the car engine overheated. Luckily we were within walking distance of a gas station and were able to refill our depleted coolant reserve - with everything (seemingly) okay, we headed back to camp for the night. 
            </p> <p> - Dan and Poom</p>

            <p>Our drive to Durango, CO was one of the best drives I’ve ever experienced. They don’t have geography like this on the East Coast - I’ll let Poom fill you in on the geological details, but it was a gorgeous and fun drive.* We set up camp at a dispersed camping site (read: free & legal) in San Juan National Forest. We got really lucky and found a great spot next to a river. The rest of the afternoon/evening was spent in Mesa Verde - another beautiful drive and overlook of the region - we could see up to 50 miles into AZ/NM/UT as well. We’re also at the southernmost edge of the Rockies and could see those as well. We did a great hike up the side of a cliff and got to see ancient Petroglyphs, carved by the Pueblos almost a thousand years ago. On our drive out of the park, we saw a bear! He was sprinting across the road in front of us, and we were very glad we hit the brakes in time. Hopefully, we don’t get any closer to a bear on this trip, but that experience tops the wildlife charts. We then made our way back to our camp and heated up chicken noodle soup for dinner, for it was pitch black by the time we arrived.
            </p><p>*Poom here. This was our first run-in with the Colorado Plateau: a geological region surrounding the four corners which were shallow tropical seas and coastal regions during much of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic (read: since the Cambrian explosion in life to the era of the dinosaurs). The region, unlike surrounding mountains, has undergone little disturbance to its horizontal bedding. As a result, the region is often used as a field case study for the field of stratigraphy: an investigation of the geological stories from modern rock samples. The well-defined beds were certainly amazing for me to witness for the first time, as I am sure it was for Dan to.
            <img src = "images/mesa_cliff.jpeg">
            </p><p>The next morning, our plan was to drive up into the Rockies and possibly do some hiking - but almost all of the coolant we had put in in Santa Fe was gone. So we filled it up again and then called every auto shop in Durango and found someone to take a look. While it was in the shop, we stopped for coffee and to catch up on blog posts. We walked around historic downtown Durango and had some excellent tacos and ice cream (not from the same place, but both great!). The mechanics we went to were more than kind to us - since they weren’t able to exactly determine / fix the problem, they didn’t charge us. They ruled a lot of things out and gave us good advice to help keep the car on the road. I made my first ever google review - and very happy the car is (probably, mostly) ok. We drove an hour to Cortez, and stopped to get some groceries and supplies for the next week. 
            </p><h3>The other corners
            <img src = "images/hat.jpeg">
            </h3><p>The next morning we made our way to our campsite about an hour north of the Grand Canyon. On the way, we passed through SE Utah and NE Arizona. Despite the car’s wounded state, we managed to hit 100,000 miles near Mexican Hat – both a settlement and a geological formation in SE Utah. To celebrate, we did a loop around the rock formation resembling a sombrero. Using his limited knowledge about rocks, Poom infers that the structure was carved out by wind. We also saw dramatic anticlines as backdrops to the Mexican Hat. We then spent most of the morning driving through Monument Valley, another spectacular sight in the Southwest. Again, they don’t have rocks like this on the East Coast. Here, we witnessed magnificent buttes –  thin, tall peaks formed when a harder rock bed protects a softer rock bed from weathering and erosion from above. Lastly, we stopped at the Glen Canyon dam to get a great view of the Colorado River. We finally crossed the river at Marble Canyon before driving parallel to the awe-inspiring Vermillion Cliffs and ascending the Kaibab Plateau – the formation hosting the topmost bed of the Grand Canyon today. While we were only a couple of miles from the four corners monument - it’s not actually geographically correct, so we decided it wasn’t worth the 20 bucks to park there and see it. 
            <img src = "images/100k.jpeg">
            </p><h3>The Grandest Staircase
            </h3><p>Dan may be able to vouch for this, but Poom has used the term “Grand Staircase” to describe the geology of the entire region, but it is such an apt term for what is going here geologically. To make a long story short, the entire history of the Colorado Plateau is laid bare for all to see. From the oldest basement rocks in the bottom of the Grand Canyon, one can “walk up the staircase” north to when the Colorado Plateau began to form around 20 million years ago. From a geological point of view, there is simply nothing quite like it anywhere else on Earth. Throughout our stay in the Grand Canyon area, we were privileged enough to lay on a stairwell and walk up and down the staircase.

            <h2>Grand Canyon</h2>
            <img src = "images/gc1.jpg">
            <p>The word grand doesn’t seem to capture the scale of this canyon. Then again, I don’t know if any other word or image could do so either. We were on the North Rim, and there weren’t too many people in the park. About five minutes in, Poom declared that the North Rim was better - there are more “smaller” canyons on this side and thus much more varied landscapes and geology closer to where we were. The canyon is over 10 miles wide and a mile deep - truly a spectacular sight. The first day we were there we drove around the rim and did a couple big hikes through the forest to get to various scenic points. On our last hike we ran into an off duty ranger camping at the summit who was photographing a raven - she gave us great advice for a bunch of parks on the trip. We ended up on the other end of the rim for sunset. This has definitely been our favorite national park so far, and it was our biggest day for steps at ~30,000. Poom seemed especially baffled that the North Rim was so under visited, especially given that we were there on Fathers Day.
            <img src = "images/gc2.jpeg">
            </p><p>The next day we decided to descend into the canyon. We descended around 2200ft, a little less than halfway down the canyon. During the hike, Poom was especially excited as we descended through each geological formation. The trail changes character as we transitioned from bed to bed. We began atop the Kaibab limestone formation before transitioning to the Coconino Sandstone formation and ending up at the very red (thank you oxidation) Hermit Shale formation. Poom was not sure if we made it to the Supai group directly below. As Poom will discuss later, this represents the different geological settings during the formation of these beds. It was a great hike, top 3 ever for Poom and definitely the best sight wise for Dan. One can also feel the temperature increase with descent, which we prepared with lots of water. Going back up was difficult at best, but we made a lot of friends along the way. We took things slow and made sure not to over exert ourselves, allowing for some time to chat with day hikers and rim-to-rim hikers alike. There were a couple of groups who had started at 2am in the south rim, and even one guy who had done that and planned to go back to the south rim the same day. We gave him some trail mix and wished him the best of luck - 48 miles plus ~11000ft in elevation is absolutely absurd for 24 hours. We also ran into a desert ecology class on a trip from UChicago - maybe we’ll meet up with them at the end of our trip in Chicago, who knows. 
            <img src = "images/gchike.jpeg">
            </p><p>Poom’s Geology Corner: The Grand Canyon represents one of the best case studies for the field of stratigraphy - piecing together a geological story from rock formations. At the Grand Canyon, this story was one of shifting coastlines, uplift, and erosion. The area that used to be the Grand Canyon was a shallow sea near the continental margin. As coastlines shifted with a varying climate, the region shifted from a river mouth to a deeper water environment hosting corals. These different environments form different types of rock, with sand stone being formed when the oceans regresses most, shale being formed nearer to the shoreline, and limestone forming deepest of all. The alternating beds essentially record where the coastline was at any given time.
            </p><p>Plate tectonics uplifted the formations in one piece without deformation. The Colorado river cuts through this feature and exposes the different layers through time. However, the record at the Grand Canyon is not quite comprehensive. Layers above the Kaibab Limestone formation were eroded away. As the Kaibab formation lines up with the end of the Paleozoic, the Grand Canyon has no record of the Mesozoic era. Put simply, the Grand Canyon has no records of dinosaurs. For that, you will need to tune in to our Utah post, where Poom will spend more time talking about the Grand Staircase.

            <img src = "images/cedar.jpg">
            <p>After leaving the Grand Canyon, we were immediately treated to a wonderful view of a part of the Grand staircase, a sedimentary geological formation recording much of the history of the region before recent geologic uplift. We stopped at LeFavre viewpoint, where 5 of these formations can be seen in rapid succession as a series of receding cliffs. Starting from the bottom, these are the chocolate, vermillion, white, gray, and pink cliffs. Over the course of two-ish days, we “climbed the staircase” from the Kaibab limestone to the top of the pink cliffs.
            </p><p>We stayed at the border town of Kanab, located next to the vermillion cliffs. Here, we enjoyed great Mexican food before resting for the day. We then spent a day in Zion, although it was closer to half of the day after we got both in the park and through the line to the shuttle system - Poom was disgruntled by the fact it felt like an amusement park. However, the park’s limited space and high visitation numbers provide no feasible alternatives. As we entered the park from the east, we saw that the canyon managed to cut through the white cliffs into the vermillion cliffs. The sandstone formations also exhibited “cross-bedding” : a geological phenomenon that indicates shifting winds during the lithification (turning sediment into rock) process. Poom must have said the word “cross-bedding” at least 15 times before we actually found parking in the park.
            </p><p>Once we managed to situate ourselves in the park, we decided to do two separate hikes. Dan did the Narrows - a popular hike through the headwaters of the Virgin River, while Poom did the hike up to Angels landing - ending short of summiting due to not being granted a permit. Poom’s hike took him up the vermillion cliffs to see the impressive down-cutting abilities of the Virgin river. At the top, Poom decided to hike a part of a backcountry trail to reach the bottom of the white cliffs and get a view of the canyon, unfortunately somewhat obscured by Angels Landing itself. Dan's hike involved wading through the river that cut into the canyon - not sure if walking through water is still considered a hike at that point, but if so it was definitely the best I’ve done. There were very smart people who hiked all the way upstream and then intertubed downstream to the end of the hike.After our day in Zion we dispersed camp in Dixie National Forest (again, for free), where we experienced the coldest night on our trip yet. The temperature dipped to around 5 degrees C (~40 F), but we managed to survive. 
            <img src = "images/narrows.jpg">
            </p><p>The next day was more of a driving / sightseeing day after our three days of hiking. On our way out of our campsite we stopped at Cedar Tree National Monument - which had a similar view to Bryce Canyon without the crowds. We also drove up to the highest point in the area (and probably our whole trip) at 11307 feet. We then started our drive to Salt Lake City and stopped at an In-N-Out on the way since it was the only one we would pass on the trip - definitely the best of what fast food has to offer. 
            </p><p>When we got to Salt Lake City, we walked around downtown near the capitol and the Salt Lake Mormon Temple. Although the temple was covered in scaffolding, you could still tell it was an impressive building. We also got ice cream from a place with a flavor called the GOAT - a goat milk based ice cream that apparently won best in America in 2019. It was very good, although the other ingredients of lemon/raspberry/almonds aren’t exactly what I prefer in ice cream. Also a side note, Salt Lake City is where the streets have no name - they’re instead numbers and directions such as W 12200 S. You would think as a fan of numbers and ease of use I would be a fan of this system, but I kind of missed named streets. 
            <img src = "images/bison.jpg">
            </p><p>We then spent the evening on Antelope Island. We saw a series of horizontal lines on the side of the hills rising from the lake. The hills represent the shorelines of the much-bigger Lake Bonneville- a lake that formed during the last ice age during which the Great Basin experienced a much wetter climate than it does today. As the lake evaporated, it left behind salt deposits forming the salt flats we observed around the modern Great Salt Lake. We did a hike out to the southern part of the island and walked on some of the salt flats - salt in all directions is definitely a new sight.

            <h2>The Moon + ID/OR/WA</h2>
            <img src = "images/moon1.jpg">
            <p> Houston - the eagle has landed. Or should it be Boise - the eagle has landed? Contrary to popular belief, the moon is accessible via the great state of Idaho - another new state for both of us. Before we got to Craters of the Moon, we made a couple of spontaneous stops along the way. Ask any American what comes to mind when Idaho is mentioned, and the answer is likely to be potatoes. In fact, the state produces up to a third of all US potato outputs. Unsurprisingly, Idaho has a potato museum. When we saw the sign we had to stop - it was a decent museum that also had very good tater tots. The museum also introduced two key elements of Idahoan geology quite nicely – the volcanic soils in the state and the large underground aquifers within the volcanic bedrock combined to form ideal conditions for potato harvest. Present-day Idaho used to be really volcanically active, something Poom will discuss later.
            </p><p>Moving from food energy to electrical energy, we then stopped at EBR-1, the world's first nuclear reactor. We received a recommendation from a fellow Grand Canyon day hiker to check out the facility, and it did not disappoint. Located pretty much “in the middle of nowhere” but above the large aquifer, the location of EBR-1 is ideal for any experimental nuclear power plant – close to water, far from people. Standing over the core of a nuclear reactor was definitely a unique experience, even with the knowledge there was less radiation left in there than there would be by going outside. The technology for 1951 was incredibly impressive - why there isn’t more nuclear energy today is a topic too long for this blog. In particular, the engineering challenges they had to contend with regarding shielding their workers from radiation – panes of glass dozens of layers thick interlaced with mineral oil, show the human will to temper nature to their wishes. Much like our next activity – escaping the heavenly bounds of terrestrial gravity into outer space!
              <img src = "images/nuclear.jpg">
            </p><p>We finally arrived on the moon, or rather Craters of the Moon National Monument. Far from the Sea of Tranquility, our initial arrival dropped us into one of the most jagged landscapes we’ve seen – the park campground. Jokes aside, the campground is situated on the newest lava flow in Craters of the Moon dating mere millenia, if not less. We went exploring in one of the caves that used to be lava  magma plumes and lava tubes that formed during lava flow. (Poom’s notes: Remember that magma is underground, lava is above ground.) Our headlamps provided approximately as much light as Sirius on a new moon night. That is – visible – but not super bright. Rather fitting as SiriusXM has been our source of music during periods without service (more to come, but no free pub). No pictures, since everything that was underground in Luray couldn’t go in the caves to protect the bats from white nose disease, a fungal disease transmitted through spores that can wreak havoc even after a decade of dormancy. It is an incredibly unique landscape and we are very happy that this was a mandatory stop on our trip. That unfortunately includes our phones and our glasses. Poom had to make do with his spare glasses – the pair that he wore throughout high school. He would rather not have such images reproduced today, so the restriction worked out great for him. 
              <img src = "images/moon2.jpg">
            </p><p>We then climbed a very steep 0.2 mile trail up a cinder cone volcano – a small volcano that erupts only once before its plumbing system is clogged up. These volcanoes eject rock fragments filled with air pockets, allowing some rock specimens to even float in water! Once we have reached the rim of the central crater, Poom uttered the undying words “That’s one small summit for man, one giant hike for mankind.” Sans American flag, Poom in cargo pants summiting the volcano will have to do for the image that he may eventually send to NASA when they recruit astronauts. That is if he could actually apply to become one.
              <img src = "images/moon3.jpg">
            </p><p>We returned to Earth the next day and made a quick stop at some Miocene and Pliocene-epoch  (around 10 to 5 million years ago) fossil beds by the Snake River before heading to Boise for lunch and had some great empanadas that were featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. We walked around a park, saw some murals, and found a great ice cream place that did flights of ice cream and beer - we didn’t partake in the beer (Don’t drink and drive!) but I feel like this should be a more common concept. We completed our drive to Baker City, Oregon where we stayed the night and also ate at a truck stop that served the largest portions imaginable, on the scale of having three whole meals.
            </p><p>The next day we went to Mount Rainier and camped at a national forest east of the park. We attempted to hike some trails, but the snow-covered nature of the trails prevented much progress from being made. Regardless, we managed to trudge through the snow to a viewpoint overlooking one of the glaciers becoming a river. We also hiked around a few partially frozen lakes (never approaching the ice too closely), and hiked a part of the Pacific Crest Trail – a long-distance hiking trail along the mountain ranges of the west coast – the Appalachian Trail’s cooler, higher (but less elevation gain overall despite being longer) western counterpart.

            <p>This means we drove approximately 2.82 hours for every hour we hiked, which Poom lamented as being not enough hiking. I will say that the driving time is tracked by the car which counts anytime the car is on, I believe the amount of time we're actually moving is about 8-10 hours less last time I checked. Additionally, I (Dan) had both the fastest driving (pure interstate driving in Utah/Idaho) and the slowest driving (also in Utah, driving/sitting in traffic in Zion). Poom, however, drove longer on average per drive. I might update this page, or you'll get more cool stats at the end of the trip, who knows! </p>

            <h2>Seattle</h2>
            <img src = "images/skyline2.jpeg">
            <p>The saying is West Coast = Best Coast, and Seattle definitely makes a good argument for that. We arrived at our turnaround and halfway point of the trip, but more importantly, we picked up Brendan at the airport that evening before accidentally taking a wrong turn and ending up back in the hour-long terminal line. More bonding time I guess. 
            </p><p>Before we began to explore Seattle, we had to complete an important mission: shipping a laptop to Carmen, friend of the trip. Poom and Brendan spent half an hour that morning trying to figure out how to ship a hazardous (lithium battery), working piece of electronics through USPS while making sure that it remains operational after the ordeal. Thanks to helpful USPS staff, we were able to ship it without much fuss (but with loads of bubble wrap). Our first day in Seattle was spent mostly at the flight museum - Seattle has a lot of history with aviation, and I learned that planes, along with geography, geology, and Pokémon, is something Poom knows everything about. Thanks to its status as a major source of timber, Seattle was able to provide the necessary resources for early flying craft production. Early planes utilized wood for its lighter weight (compared to metallurgical technologies at the time) for almost all rigid parts: the frame/fuselage, the wings, the empennage (tails), the landing gear, and even the propeller. The museum had planes from every era, including the Concorde, the FIRST 747 Jumbo Jet, one of the model 787s. I guess we didn’t get enough of the moon at Craters of the Moon, as they had everything from recovered space shuttles to space suits. We then had some amazing noodles at Biang Biang noodles before heading towards the water and Pikes Place for ice cream. We chose an interesting place that had cultured gelato, and was somewhere in between frozen yogurt and gelato. While by the water, there was a large outdoor checkers and chess set. I (Dan) got challenged by a 7 year old in chess and lost my queen in four moves (d4 e5 f3 exd5 qxd5 nc6 Qc3??) - but made a good comeback and ended up winning the game. I felt bad about beating an elementary schooler but to be fair he did play in the kid national championships and was up a queen so I think it was fine. He was a good sport, and my recent rollercoaster of infrequent chess performances continues. 
              <img src = "images/space.jpeg">
            </p><p>(Brendan here:) I thought Dan was going to lose to the kid from the start so I felt like he was justified in taking him down.
            </p><p>The next day Poom and Brendan took the train up to the University of Washington (UDub) while Dan went to a camera shop to develop film and unsuccessfully try and fix a film camera. The train was nice, but we were wondering how they did fare checks. According to Poom, the way they do it in Germany is that they only occasionally send officers to check tickets, but if they catch you without one you have to pay a 60 euro fine in addition to the fare. Seattle seemed to have no fare checking mechanism at all. We then met Dan's cousin for lunch at a seafood place, where most of us got some sort of fish n chips. We then went to the beach and touched the Pacific Ocean* (ok it was a sound but pretty close). The Seattle aquarium had naturalists out on the beach since it was a freakishly low tide (Poom here: the Solstice amplifies the effect that the Sun’s gravity have on tides, amplifying the tidal range), and we saw some wild starfish, sea anemone, sea cucumbers, and more. We found more weird ice cream and got flavors inspired/created with beer. Brendan was particularly excited about his choices (Pear/blue cheese and olive oil). We then ran some errands, including getting a very expensive oil change, before getting dinner at an African/Asian fusion place that was good. 
              <img src = "images/skyline1.jpeg">
            </p><p>The next morning we were up bright and early to begin our journey east. Not up early enough though to avoid sitting in Seattle rush hour, but we eventually got around the city and headed towards the city of Leavenworth. Brendan’s introduction to hiking on this trip was a trial by fire (or by mountain?), as we did both our longest and highest elevation gain hike of the trip (9.6 miles, 2350ft) up to Colchuck Lake per recommendations from friends of the trip. It was a pretty great hike, but Brendan basically sprinted down the mountain. We'll see how much more hiking we can convince him to do. The town of Leavenworth is modeled after a German town in the Alps. The street names were in German (I.e. Edelweiss Weg; Edelweiss Way). Businesses have German names such as Der Sportmann and München Haus. However, Poom was a bit irked that the names did not conform to German declension rules. The adjectives declined to be declined correctly. Regardless, we enjoyed German sausage, beer, and ice cream (not German) while we were there. After another Costco stop for gas and everything except the one thing we went in there for (belvitas). We spent the rest of the evening driving on 90 to Spokane where we stayed the night.

            <h2>Glacier</h2>
            <img src = "images/201.jpeg">
            <p>Our drive east towards Glacier was relatively uneventful (Poom/driver of this section here: it was very rainy mountainous driving; this comment by Dan & Brendan makes me feel a lot better about my driving skills!) besides our stop at St.Regis, Montana - famous for its milkshakes. Advertised as the “best milkshake,” we got huckleberry shakes and we didn’t think it was false advertising - they were very good. On our way, we passed by a car with a Diplomat registration (they also deserve days off) and Flathead Lake – the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi. We then got to camp near Hungry Horse and hung out there for the rest of the night. Brendan and Poom went for a swim in the lake before Brendan defeated us in poker (his prize: choosing an activity in Glacier). We are fairly North now, so much so that it didn’t get darker than astronomical twilight. Between clouds, the moon, and light pollution we haven’t gotten a real night of stargazing, but we are hopeful that a new moon in the badlands will yield spectacular stars. 
            </p><p>We had secured a day of reservation for the Going to the Sun road, the main road through the park. We spent the morning/early afternoon on the scenic drive, stopping to take in the snow covered mountains, rivers, and forests. Poom was geeking out at the folds on the cliffside, suggesting that the rocks underwent metamorphism during the formation of the Rockies. The afternoon we embarked on yet another intense hike up one of the mountains. The trail was exposed as most of the nearby forest had burned down in 2003, and has spectacular views the whole way up (half a mile in elevation, eight in distance). Along the way, Poom was again fascinated with the wavy patterns on the rocks, suggesting that those rocks were sedimentary rocks that formed in an environment with wave action. This caught him by surprise, especially because he dismissed Brendan’s suggestion of the rocks in the park being sedimentary. After this incident, Poom wonders more and more how he was able to get a degree in Geology. We were officially hiking in bear country and were thankful not to have to use our bear spray, but we did see about a half dozen deer on the trail though. We made it up to a mountain chalet serving day hikers and backcountry hikers alike, where we discovered that the trail we hiked up was “bear habitat” and considered “very steep.” Needless to say, we made sure to make plenty of noise on our way down (mainly unBEARable singing). Our campsite for the night was in the park and also on a lake - which Poom and Brendan again wasted no time swimming in, while Dan was very content in being warm.
            <img src = "images/hike.jpeg">
            </p><p>The next day we slept in and without any real plans we drove along the south border of the park to get to the eastern side. We crossed the Continental Divide, where we were able to see a big thrust fault (pieces moving together). We then found ourselves in Two Medicine Valley, where we did a couple of shorter walks to a waterfall and a lake and decided to hang around the lake for the day. On one of those walks a kind stranger took the first picture on this post of the three of us, 10/10. At the lake we worked on skipping rocks, as the rocks seemingly eroded into thin sheets perfect for rock skipping. Poom claimed that he was able to get more than 10 skips, but the lack of reproducibility has the rest of us in doubt. We then had lunch and then kayaked around the lake, surrounded by mountains on pretty much all sides. Dan wanted to go at it solo so Brendan and Poom teamed up to defeat him in a kayaking race at the end. Before then, Poom had a good opportunity to incorrectly use nautical terms like “starboard” to not only mean right, but to also head right. Perhaps tired of Poom’s role-playing as the captain, the real coxswain Brendan (by which he sat at the stern the boat) decided to drink the lake water to enter a different state of mind (and perhaps a different state of life). He did end up successfully driving to Great Falls, MT with no issues, so it seems like he’ll survive.

          <div id="Yellowstone" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>Yellowstone</h2>
            <p>Warning - this is a long post. Poom cooked? Proceed with caution.
              <img src = "images/yellowstone.jpeg">
            </p><p>We began our drive to Yellowstone bright and early Sunday morning. Not long after we left Great Falls, we crossed the Missouri River six times in rapid succession as it flowed through a canyon surrounded by what appeared to be granite walls. We then had good burgers in Ennis, MT before beginning our final push into Yellowstone. 
            </p><p>We waited to enter Yellowstone behind heavy traffic. Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks, for good reason — it offers visitors a variety of landforms filled with wildlife. Yellowstone’s unique geological setting — a caldera for a supervolcano — is home to features otherwise rare on Earth. It is home to a majority of the world’s active geysers, along with hosting mud volcanoes and thick igneous rock beds. Surprisingly, Poom did not seem as impressed by Yellowstone upon first entering the park. The rocks looked relatively uniform and the river “meh” compared to Glacier and the traffic so much worse. This quickly changed after we took a scenic drive paralleling the main road. There, we saw Yellowstone’s premier swimming spots, more evidence of Yellowstone’s volcanic past, and uniformly short pine trees. On a different note, we completed our license plate game within an hour of entering the park - for a while we were just missing Rhode Island and New Hampshire - we got our Rhode Island friend in Glacier and New Hampshire in Yellowstone. We’ve also collected most of the Canadian provinces along the way as well. 
            </p><p>We then made our way to Yellowstone’s most famous attraction — Old faithful geyser. Erupting at very regular intervals, it provides brief visitors like us a chance to witness one of nature’s most amazing phenomena — a geyser eruption. The roughly 90-minute intervals between eruptions provide visitors with many chances to witness steaming hot water shooting high into the sky. Poom was yet again turned off by the number of people, quoting the whole experience as “amusement park-esque”. He hoped that his time in Yellowstone wouldn’t be as packed. He would get his wish shortly.
            </p><p>We made our way to the Old Faithful Lodge where we met up with a photographer friend of Dan's dad, who was gracious enough to provide us with an employee cabin right next to Old Faithful while he was working in another area of the park that week. We were graced with a shower, a flush toilet, and two comfy beds. Per advice we received, we decided to do a hike to Mallard Lake. The hike contained more elevation gain than we expected, but it was beautiful to hike through the short pine trees (again, more about them soon), the granite boulder fields before ending up at the lake. Poom got quite scared of a small snake we ran into on the trail, but snakes were soon the least of our worries as we got bombarded by a cloud of mosquitoes. We got to get to the lake, then immediately rushed back to avoid additional bites. We ended the hike with a dip in the cold Firehole River (before it meets the geysers) and a close encounter with a bison. It was Brendan’s favorite trail up to this point, other than the mosquitoes.
            </p><p>After a quick meal of sandwiches (beginning of the Poom and Brendan sandwich rebellion), we continued to explore some more springs and geysers around the Grand Prismatic Spring and some of the other geyser basins. Grand Prismatic Springs was absolutely gorgeous with the rims forming a beautiful rainbow hue. Poom’s personal favorite spring was Sapphire springs — the water in it was the most beautiful shade of blue he had ever seen. This joy was however short lived as the sun had just set. Mosquitoes, perhaps a bit vengeful of the killings we have previously committed on the Mallard Lake trail, came out in droves. We quickly returned to the car and ended our stroll. 
              <img src = "images/grandprim.jpeg">
            </p><p>The next day we set our sights on the Yellowstone canyon — a wonderful display of differential erosion between the softer water-influenced rhyolite and the harder rhyolite at its bed. While both likely formed as a result of lava flow during one of Yellowstone’s previous eruptions, they have different physical properties due to water’s impact on the rock’s physical structure. It is the softer bed that likely gave Yellowstone its name — they are very yellow! We visited a vista point of the upper falls before hiking downstream along the south rim of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River to Sublime Point. The views of the downstream valley were sublime, but the mosquitoes were most definitely not. They were all over us again, so regrettably we bid farewell from the vista point soon after our arrival. We then visited the visitor center after trying at least thrice (and failing) to get onto the scenic drive. Unlike other scenic drives , this one was very popular.
            </p><p>At the visitor center, we learnt about the geology of Yellowstone in detail. We found out that Mallard Lake, the lake we previously hiked to, is at the center of a lava dome, causing the area to rise relative to surrounding land. We then made our obligatory stop for ice cream before returning to the geysers once more. This time, we visited Steamboat Geyser, the tallest geyser in the world (when a major eruption happens). Along the way, we passed by a hot spring that smells like instant noodles. This worked up Poom’s and Brendan’s appetite for them, something which they would later try to make on the next day with hot water stolen from the general store. In the aftermath of what turned out to be a rather mediocre dinner from the park service’s offerings, a simple instant  ramen dinner tasted amazing!
            </p><p>Back to the previous day (after the mediocre dinner), we went to see more geysers and saw Castle geyser erupt for an impressive 40 minutes.  It was simply amazing, especially with the intermittent rain amplifying the steam thickness coming out of the geyser. More on the mediocre dinner, because it was pretty much all Brendan was thinking about. That day, he was very excited to try some of the park’s Indian food offerings—specifically the coconut shrimp curry, which he saw while Poom was getting relatively expensive black coffee. However, having arrived at the cafeteria a mere 45 minutes before closing, all of the Indian options were out, save the less than generously priced buffalo vindaloo. Poom and Brendan were forced to get lamb gyros, which were among the more flavorless things eaten on the trip. Brendan wanted to go to flavor town, and he was dropped about a thousand miles outside of city limits. 
              <img src = "images/castle.jpeg">
            </p><p>The next day we sought to explore the Lake District of Yellowstone. At our first stop, we saw more geysers, but they were right by a volcanic crater turned bay of the lake. Here, we saw an armada of kayaks (or, as a nearby older lady quipped, “here comes the Yellowstone Navy”). We then went to a bridge over the Yellowstone River named “Fishing Bridge,” which funnily enough bans fishing. Nearby, we found a device used to measure river flow rate installed by the USGS. We then walked by a big river rapid and stopped at a mud volcano. During our short hike, we ran into bison traffic. A bison was happily feeding no more than 10 feet from the trail while its cubs crossed back and forth. To the cubs, the grass was greener on the other side (of the trail). As it is generally advised to give wildlife a distance of at least 25 yards (23 meters), we stopped and eventually turned back. We eventually got to see the mud volcanoes, but not before inhaling a copious amount of hydrogen sulfide. The bison really said “Last one is a rotten egg”, or I guess in this case it would be “Last one must smell a rotten egg”.
              <img src = "images/ys_lake.jpeg">
              <img src = "images/bison.jpeg">
            </p><p>We then walked to Yellowstone’s natural bridge, a small (60 feet/18 meter tall) arch in the rhyolitic rock. The hike was a stroll, but climbing up to the arch was a bit arduous, or ARCHduous as Poom puts it. While everyone walked to the arch, only Poom had the motivation to actually make it onto the bridge. We then went to another one of the Yellowstone visitor centers. This time, we learned about the role of wildfires at Yellowstone and its impacts on biological succession. In particular, we learned about the once every 250-300 year great fire in the summer of 1988. This explains the uniformly short pine trees we saw — they all arose in the aftermath of that great fire. The most interesting part of the exhibit was how the public perception of fires changed in the decade past the fire. Most reporters of the time were busy pointing fingers at the park to take responsibility, as they had implemented a new policy to let natural fires occur in order to protect fire-reliant ecologies. They were certain that the fire amounted to a loss of the pristine wilderness that park goers had become accustomed to. Eventually, attitudes changed, and by the late 1990s the public began seeing fires as natural processes. We then passed the continental divide twice before returning to our base. We tried in vain to look for the Continental Divide Trail (CDT, or the Couldn’t find the Damn Trail), before discovering that the trail that goes through the geysers was allegedly a part of the CDT. Thus, we could now claim we hiked the big 3 trails in the U.S. - the AT, PCT, and the CDT. 
              <img src = "images/bridge.jpeg">
            </p><p>Before leaving the park, we passed by Mammoth hot springs and got to see a step-like formation for hot springs as the dissolved calcium carbonate crystallized into limestone lining the rims of the hot springs. On our way out of Yellowstone, we saw hundreds of bison and drove on the 10945 ft tall beartooth highway. It was snowing when we arrived at the very top, even though it is July! The road twists and turns as it descends into Billings, Montana. There, we had delicious Italian sandwiches in the basement of a bank building (2/2 for food in the basement of office buildings for the record). With that, we made our way to Gillette, Wyoming, where we would be posted up for the night before we headed off to South Dakota. Both Dan and Brendan dozed off on the way, and Poom braved rain and wind to get us there safely. After checking in at our hotel, we stocked up on some groceries for the coming three nights of camping. We then made our way to a chicken restaurant that Poom had found while we were on our way to Billings. Its specialty was the chicken pot pie, which we ordered, in addition to an entire rotisserie chicken. It was a mountain of food, but we made our way through most of it, with some leftovers for our first night of camping in the Black Hills.

            <h2>The Black Hills</h2>
            <img src = "images/blackhills.jpeg">
            <p>After leaving the hotel, we took a Poom-sanctioned detour to Devils Tower. At once a sacred site to the Kiowa and Lakota peoples and a breathtaking geologic feature, this national monument was definitely attracting a lot of tourist attention on the Fourth of July. While driving towards the visitor center parking lot, we decided to cut our losses and turn around. Luckily, there was a pullout lower on the hill with connecting trails to the summit. On the way, we took the time to enjoy the company of some prairie dogs, which were both really cute, loud, and kind of aggressive to each other. We collectively decided to take the four mile hike up to and then around the base of the monument. While the initial ascent was challenging, the rest of the trail was moderate and provided a good view of both the geologic formation and the basin below. On this topic, allow me (Brendan) to do my best to poorly explain the geology of the formation. Millions of years ago, magma was bubbling just slightly underground. As it cooled into igneous rock, it was able to survive erosion much better than the loose soil / sedimentary rock of the surrounding basin. The column-like appearance of Devil's tower occurs because of geometric fractures of the rock, and these lattices go through the entire structure, not just the exterior. While hiking, we saw a few people scaling it, probably in celebration of the first known ascent on the Fourth of July a few hundred years ago. After we returned to our parked car, we made some sandwiches, refilled our water, and made our way to Mount Rushmore.
            <img src = "images/devilstower.jpeg">
            </p><p>Upon General Dan’s orders, we decided to take the route through the Black Hills national forest, which consisted of tens of miles of dirt roads. This definitely took a few years off of the car’s shelf life, but it also meant that we were able to interact with a “cow garden” where cows were roaming the open road. We ran into many a jeep and dune buggy, all vehicles that were much better suited to these conditions. After finally exiting the gravelly section, we went right into a section of sharp twists and turns, testing the limits of what already appears to be a shell of a vehicle. We finally arrived at our campground at around 4:30, where Brendan had the great idea to push for Poom’s original plan of taking a nearly four mile hike to the base of Mount Rushmore. This was met by grumbles by both Dan and Poom, a rare occasion. As we started on the so-called “wilderness trail,” it soon became apparent that this would not be a flat trail. The beginning was almost as steep as the mountain hikes in Washington, and then quickly devolved into a trail that seemed to have been cleared for horse travel. We waded through waist and arm-high weeds, and surprisingly were left with minimal markings on our legs. Brendan was sensing that his fellow hikers were disgruntled, and decided to mostly stay quiet and carry the waters. Many of the rocks on the way were Mount Rushmore-esque, but it was not until about an hour and a half later that the recognizable faces came into view clearly. It felt really worth it to work for the destination in this case.
            </p><p>As we walked up to the monument, we were feeling pretty proud that we didn’t pay ten dollars for parking, like nearly all of the people at the monument. After a few quick pictures, we went to wait for ice cream, proceeding to spend 3x the amount on three ice cream cones that supposedly were Thomas Jefferson’s original recipe. They were good, but Brendan started getting very cold. We had to make it back to camp, stat. After everyone finished their ice creams and went to the bathroom, we made a group decision to walk alongside the road to our campsite, which would theoretically be at least twice as fast as our hike up. The hike turned out to be pretty beautiful, as golden hour light was hitting rock formations that we couldn’t see up close on the hike up to Rushmore. We made it back safely, and began cooking dinner. While Brendan was looking forward to a cleansing dip into the lake in lieu of a shower, he soon realized that this lake was not nearly as private or pristine as any of the lakes in Glacier or Yellowstone. Instead, he opted for a wet towel. For dinner, we whipped up some pesto pasta, including the chicken we got from the restaurant the previous night. It was good, but Brendan became sad as he realized that he had to do all the dishes, having lost at poker the previous night. 
              <img src = "images/rushmore.jpeg">
            </p><p>As it was getting dark, we decided to venture out to Custer to see fireworks. Since Dan and Poom had beers with dinner, it was up to the heroic action of Brendan to take the group there. Night driving was not terrible, but we had a close deer encounter on the way there. By the time we arrived in Custer, the last of the fireworks had just been let off. We sulked away in traffic and headed back to the campsite, glad to have seen at least a few minutes of the celebration from the road. The sky at the campsite was incredibly clear, and the stars were a lot clearer than anywhere that we had been yet.
            </p><p>The next day, we planned to explore Custer State Park but decided to stop in the town near Mt. Rushmore to play mini golf, where Dan unsurprisingly won by twenty strokes. Poom came in second, not bad for never having played before. It was there we got a call from the place that we stayed at in Gillette saying they had Poom’s laptop. With only being 100ish miles away, we decided to take a detour back to Wyoming to retrieve it, as there were some local documents that Poom needed to send out before the trip was over as they were visa-related. We used the opportunity to take different routes back, and we stopped at a fantastic Ramen place in Rapid City that was featured on an episode of Diners Drive-Ins and Dives that we happened to see on a random tv while we were in Seattle. We all got bison ramen, which we were a bit conflicted to order after seeing bison all week, especially Dan being a Bills fan, but have to admit it was very very good. After getting the laptop we took a bit of a southern route back through the black hills to get to Custer, and thus we are now experts on all three (approximately equally timed) routes from Gillette to Custer. We spent the evening driving and stopping along some of the roads through Custer state park, including this famously needle shaped spire. Poom commented that Custer could probably be a national park with its diverse landscape and plenty of cool things to see and do.

          <div id="The Badlands" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>The Badlands</h2>
            <img src = "images/badlands.jpeg">
            <p>This is most likely our last national park and experience in the wild. Most think of remote forests when they think of the wilderness, but having the grasslands and badlands unfold before us in all directions is truly a sight. I (Dan) cautiously claim we saved the best for last. I will also (again, cautiously) give a brief geological rundown.
            </p><p>The Badlands only started eroding into what it looks like today half a million years ago. Additionally, this will all be flat due to erosion within the next half a million years, which on a geological scale is fairly quickly. You would think this park would be especially concerned about visitor-caused erosion, but on the contrary you’re allowed to walk almost anywhere in the park - all badlands are climbable badlands. The rocks in the parks formed from marine deposition during the late Cretaceous (see Cretaceous Seaway) and river deposition during the Cenozoic. This means that visitors often find fossils in the park, but they are all mammal fossils instead of dinosaurs. You could also see clear bands of volcanic ash in the badland formations, which Poom frequently went up to and inspected to confirm his suspicions. 
              <img src = "images/canyon.jpeg">
            </p><p>We did a couple of hikes in the northeastern part of the park, including a very neat one that required us to use a rope ladder to go down one of the badlands after hiking up it. After consuming more sandwiches, we drove around the rest of the area, stopping at a few points to scout out potential places to do backcountry hiking the next day. However, certain individuals were not as keen as others as setting out into the wilderness, so we ended up scrapping that part of the plan. On our way out of the park, we stopped in Wall, SD - arguably the most road stoppy road stop where we walked around for a bit and got ice cream. We were still camping in Custer that night, so we backtracked once again towards Rapid City and completed our side quest of having Thai food in a random place in middle America. While not the most authentic, it was good and exactly what people wanted at the time. We got back to Custer via the iron mountain road, a road that assures you haven’t made a real turn until you’ve driven on this road, with multiple 360 degree turns and plenty of narrow switchbacks. There are also a couple of tunnels that frame Rushmore, which was always a cool sight. 
              <img src = "images/goat.jpeg">
            </p><p>he next day we set out onto the landscape on the Castle Trail, where we hiked almost 12 miles through the grassland with badlands surrounding us. We stopped at a particularly climbable badland to eat lunch (see photo below), but it was an absolutely gorgeous hike. After the hike we drove to the western/southern end of the park while observing a very cool thunderstorm. By then we were hungry, so we went to a bar in Interior (which had the only food within 50 miles of the badlands) and had Indian (Native American) Tacos. They were great, and while we were waiting we showed everyone there that we did not go to bars regularly as our pool abilities were severely lacking.

            <h2>The Midwest</h2>
            <img src = "images/madison.jpeg">
            <p>Welcome to our mega-blog! We decided to group the rest of the trip into this post, even though it is kind of insane that PA and SD are often both grouped as the “midwest.”</p>
            <h3>The Twin Cities</h3>
            <p>It took us most of the day to actually get to St. Paul. On the way, Brendan managed to set the speed record for the trip (REDACTED) and we stopped in Sioux Falls for lunch. Brendan and Poom trekked out to the Falls (with blocky, red quartzite!) Once we arrived in St.Paul, we spent the evening with a reunion of two of our great friends who lived across the street from us last year and went out for great Nepalese food. Poom and Brendan ordered their curries hot, which caused them to combust after the meal. After putting out the dumpster fires, we of course also had a game night and played codenames (you can play online, 10/10 game). Poom orchestrated a comeback of the century, a fact he parrots to Dan whenever he had the chance to do so (including this blog). Dan here - they still lost 3-1 overall. </p>
            <p>The next day we bid farewell to one of our friends as she embarked on a cross-country journey of her own. We then made breakfast, went to see a tributary waterfall of the Mississippi (which exposed limestone and sandstone beds dating to the Paleozoic), stopped for “Pothole-flavored Ice Cream (was actually very good!)” and stopped by a local bookstore. Dan ended up starting and finishing a book that day, and it had been over a year since he read a book not for school.  Meanwhile, Brendan attempted to humor Poom with a book by the popular social media account “Terrible Maps”, with limited success (jk it was actually quite funny) and Poom got into the weeds of climate policy. We then bought groceries to make lunch and dinner. Under the helpful guidance of Head Chef Bho & sous chef Poom, a tasty red curry was served with rice. We then went out to one of Minnesota's 10,000+ lakes for a swim & ice cream (round 2 but only for Dan) before returning home to make stir fry for dinner. After moving at a breakneck pace for the past month, a slow & chill day was certainly welcomed.</p>
            <img src = "images/st.paul.jpeg">
            <h3>Wisconsin</h3> 
            <p>The next day we bid farewell yet again. This time, it was Brendan and one of our friends going to visit another friend. We dropped them off at the airport early in the morning and set out to the great state of Wisconsin. We stopped in Madison for lunch with a friend and had some great fried cheese curds and cheeseburgers. As a dairy product enthusiast, I can confirm that Wisconsin is on top. We also spent the rest of the afternoon in Madison, where we again went to a lake and got ice cream at the University of Wisconsin. Dan got a flavor called blue moon, and it was good although he could not identify the flavor other than “berry” but it was not as artificial as its neon blue color would lead you to believe. One could say Dan was over the (blue) moon. Poom went for an orange custard flavor with chocolate chips. It was a medley of flavors that worked together quite well. After ice cream we decided to head into the state capitol building, and we also did a short hike out to one of the peninsulas near Madison to get a great view of the entire lake. On our way out of Wisconsin, we stopped in Milwaukee a bit to walk around and see the city. We walked along the city’s riverwalk and stopped by a soul music event. </p>

            <h3>Chicago</h3>
            <p>We may have overslept, but the next day we headed into the city of Chicago with one goal - deep dish. As we were getting ready to leave, Poom’s uncaffeinated brain chatted with a friendly housekeeping staff about his plans to “head into town” that day. We went to a place called Gino’s, where all the walls and booths were covered with graffiti by its patrons. While we were waiting we debated if deep dish was still pizza or closer to something like lasagna (result: inconclusive) but the deep dish was great and we were pretty much full for the rest of the day. (Warning: two slices are alright, more slices will make you tight). We then ventured up to the North side of the city and walked along Lake Michigan and through various parks. We walked by a golf course next to a lake, where Dan was eager to show off his golf game (and that, unlike either of the presidential candidates, he does not need a handicap). Poom took the opportunity to hit the beach, while Dan lounged around in a grassy field not far from the shoreline. As the largest freshwater lake in the world (by surface area when combined with Lake Huron, technically a single geologic lake), it still baffles us how much the beach looks like any beach towns along the oceans, except that the water is fresh. For the rest of the evening we met up with two of the UChicago students we met hiking in the Grand Canyon (truly a crazy way to meet new friends). We had dinner at a dumpling restaurant and dessert at a mango themed place, which were both very good. After that we headed to our new friends’ place in Hyde Park. We explored the neighborhood and UChicago, during which we got to see many of their academic buildings and tried out Malört. After sobering up from the tour of UChicago, we bid our new friends farewell.</p>

            <h3>Indiana</h3>
            <p>On our way to see our friends in Michigan we spent our morning/early afternoon in Indiana. What did we see? DUNES! That’s right, we weren’t done with national parks as we visited the Indiana dunes and went for a couple of quick hikes and a swim. We also had just a very nice drive through the park along Lake Michigan and the towns on the lake. The dunes around Lake Michigan are an incredibly dynamic landscape shaped by the maximum glacial extent during the most recent ice age. The dunes are what geologists call “moraines” – pilings of unconsolidated sediments that the glaciers move from their original sources to the north. We got to see the unique impacts that this piling leaves on the landscape – wetlands behind the dunes. Because of the unique physical environment of this location, the dunes are supposedly a great spot for birdwatching. Instead of birdwatching, however, Dan and Poom went to the beach for a swim in Lake Michigan after summiting a sand dune. It was a wonderful break from the heat, although the looming power plant cooling tower not far from the beach does give slight cause for concern. Managing to emerge from the water without extra limbs, Dan and Poom continued their drive up north to Michigan. </p>

            <h3>Michigan</h3>
            <p>Our time in Michigan was similar to our time in the twin cities - we hung out with Dan’s friends from high school who just moved out to East Lansing. During our stay, we played many board and card games which I think Poom was very happy to see my friends beat me in everything we played. One of the games we played was a newer version of uno branded as Uno No Mercy, a very appropriate name with cards reaching up to +10, which were very satisfying to inflict. We also walked around the Michigan State campus before heading to yet another lake to eat ice cream at. Our explorations in East Lansing also led us to their massive farmers market that also doubled as a beer garden, so most people were walking around with beers as they shopped. Overall, East Lansing was very nice and it was lovely to see my friends!</p>
            <h3>The Drive Home</h3>
            <p>The drive home from Michigan was supposed to be 9 hours. To our surprise, this was the second-hottest day of our trip, right behind our trip to the Grand Canyon. We stopped in our last national park on this trip – Cuyahoga Valley National Park in Ohio, to hike among rocks dating back to the Carboniferous period (~330 million years ago). We also spent some time in Pittsburgh, admiring bridges as well as a fantastic sandwich shop. We passed 10,000 miles on the trip, which is about exactly when one of our calipers seized up. Although we managed to make it home safe and sound, it wasn’t the most surprising that 10k miles in 40 days the car did not make it unscathed. </p>

            <p>And just as fast as the journey began, it had come to an end. We’ll have a whole post for that, as well as a musical and statistical conclusion for the trip as well. Thanks to everyone who helped us on our journey, and hope anyone reading this is well!</p>
            <h3>Stats</h3>
            <p>For those wondering what the box score stats were, here is the reveal!</p>

            <h3> Music </h3>
            <p> Not listed here is probably the song of the trip, which Dan claims to be Creatures in Heaven by Glass Animals (new album out now, 10/10 would recommned). As you can see, a bit more diverse in taste with Brendan on the trip.</p>

            <h3>The End</h3>
            <p>We wanted to thank some people, mainly everyone who let us stay with them over the trip, gave us recommendations, and our families for letting us do this in the first place. I’m only going to speak for myself here (Dan), but I’ll get Poom and Brendan to add to this later. (Sorry for the delay, when I got home I immediately got sick and slept for most of the week). 24 states, 10,000 miles, 40 days. Those are crazy numbers, but they don’t quantify the whole journey. It was absolutely a fantastic journey, and I will forever be grateful for the time I got to spend with my two best friends. It was great to just be and see parts of the country that I haven’t experienced. I got to learn a lot about myself, my friends, geology, and about what America is for so many more people. 
            </p><p>Additionally, as I make and organize websites for my personal portfolio and photography, this blog might get moved, just a warning if you come back to check this at a later date, feel free to reach out. There’s still a couple more updates to be put here, mainly Dan’s (and Brendan’s if he decides to share) photography from the trip (sneak peak on this post) as well as possibly a large spotify playlist for the music we explored on this trip. Additionally, we still have some data from I-40 to go through and visualize.
