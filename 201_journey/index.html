            <h2>The 201 Journey: Prelude / About this Trip: </h2>
            <img src = "images/journey.jpg">
            <p>This summer, my two roommates Brendan, Poom and I have decided to enjoy our fleeting youth and lack of responsibilities by driving to Seattle and back. While I’m not sure exactly when the idea came about, there was a time where we didn’t know if Poom was going to be in the U.S., so we would take the opportunity to see the country together. We’ll largely be camping, as well as staying with friends and family (thank you!!!!). We acknowledge that we’re very privileged to be able to do something like this, and we plan on doing some good along the way. We'll have more to say on this, but for now it is important to note that many of the national parks are unable to sustain their visitors as well as occupying stolen land. From environmental, photographic, and respectful perspectives, we aim to hold ourselves to a higher standard.<p>

            <p>You’ll get updates from us here, as well as some stats, oddities, stories, and some photos along the way. Largely, this is a good way to let our friends/family know we're still alive. My photography (some digital, some color film) from this trip will be available somewhere at some point, the photos with the blog will likely be shot on iPhone </p>

                Why is this website so bad? Don’t you all do some sort of computer science?
                Yes and yes. I made it from scratch the day before we left (and I don't make websites) - it might get better, it might not. Graphic design is not our passion.

          <h2>Appalachia</h2>
          <img src = "images/app.jpg">
          <p> We left “my” house at precisely 9.15am on June 5, 2024 to begin our cross-country roadtrip. Within the first hour of the drive, we managed to spot a Cybertruck and a “Legotruck” in the wild. We were fortunate enough to be joined by two friends currently based out of the DMV area (not to be confused with the Department of Motor Vehicles) as we explored Luray Caverns – supposedly the largest cave system east of the Appalachians. </p>
          <p>We stretched our imaginations trying to match the stalactite and stalagmites to shapes we knew. I also unsuccessfully tried to identify some of the host rocks surrounding the limestone formations. What I have been doing these past four years I will never know. We then went for lunch at a cat-themed cafe before bidding farewell to our friends in the DMV. </p>
          <p>The Dodge Journey then had its first mountain road test as we climbed the Blue Ridge Mountains to our first national park on this trip – Shenandoah. We then drove on Skyline Drive, making sure to stop at overlooks along the way. The intermittent rain of the day added fog to the sides of the mountains, adding an atmosphere of mystique. We then hiked along part of the Appalachian Trail (AT) – perhaps the world’s longest walking trail – to get to a granite overlook we had seen on Skyline Drive. We then attempted to hike down to Whiteoak Falls on the Robinson River but the humidity got to us. We made it to the pool at the top of the falls before deciding to turn back, but not before we were rewarded with an amazing view of the southeast and of the waterfall itself.</p>
          <p>We then camped at the biggest campground either of us had ever been to, complete with all luxuries such as flushing bathrooms, showers (!!), and even laundry services. As it was the first day of camping, Dan and I wanted to test how bad we would smell after camping so we did not use any of those services. Our campsite was small but had everything we needed. We experienced strong winds throughout the night, but our tent withstood the winds without much issue. We spent almost half an hour figuring out every component of setting up the tent, a figure which we weren’t too satisfied about.</p>
          <p>During our drive on Skyline Drive, we managed to spot a few deer on the side of the road. We appreciated being able to see them from afar, but we wondered how the construction of the drive had affected their behavior. </p>
          <p>The next day, we drove from Shenandoah to the Smokies. As Dan drove for most of the previous day, I instead took the wheel for most of the drive. We stopped at a cafe next to Roanoke College to sort out Poom’s remaining commitments, including his housing situation, then stopped at a drive-in in the next town over. It was my first experience at a drive-in, and I was sure that anyone else there would have been able to tell because I needed Dan to guide me through the process. We would pull into a parking spot, wait for an attendant to take our order from the comforts of our car, and then have the food delivered to us. I had the world’s reddest hotdog (apparently), which was good. We then drove to our campground, but not before we struggled with finding the cheapest gas prices around in eastern TN. The cheapest we found was $2.74/gallon (26.66 baht/liter for my Thai friends). The gas station was next to a Walmart parking lot, which was occupied by a replica of a Confererate-era submarine, complete with flags from the era… We then stopped at an apple orchard and grabbed some apples, in hopes that we maintain good health for the rest of the journey and keep the doctors away for a bit (well, I might become one in the future but I digress)</p>
          <p>Our campsite in the Smokies was a nice, secluded campsite by a creek. At all campsites, we take great care in making sure that all of our trash is properly disposed of, especially food items. We have taken great care in ensuring that bears won’t be able to access our food during our stay. Once we were situated, we went on a hike to a waterfall in hopes of cooling down (and maybe swim). We hiked to Hen Wallow Falls and enjoyed walking over the log bridges across streams and admired the lush scenery along the trail. We then returned to camp to attempt to cook pasta. The stove gave us an as-of-now unsolved issue, but we managed to test out the setup and made pretty good pasta. We then cleaned up the cooking scene before retiring for the night. </p>
          <p>Our day in the Smokies itself was filled with the constant rattling of my kettle, much to Dan’s chagrin. Once we had packed up camp and driven to our first trail however, such chagrin evaporated. We followed Dan’s mom’s recommendations for hiking and had an enjoyable hike up to Chimney Top Overlook (the trail beyond was closed due to a recent fire, something which did not deter some). The trail was STEEP in certain sections, taking me back to the one HIIT class I showed up to at Brown but the view was worth it. We then followed the horde of people to Clingman’s Dome – the highest point of the Smokies, where we briefly entered into North Carolina and sat in 45 minutes of parking lot traffic with a BEAUTIFUL view to our left. We again briefly hiked the AT and crossed back and forth between Tennessee and North Carolina. Throngs of people were doing the same hike, including a pretty smart fellow who tried to defy gravity by walking backward uphill. We then drove to another over vista point and spotted (hitch)hikers. We unfortunately could not assist them but wish them the best of luck in their own journeys. We then grabbed free, freshly made glazed donuts as we left the park on National Donut Day. Our drive to Nashville was uneventful, save for a stop at Buc-ee’s. The place is MASSIVE! We then ended the day at Dan’s aunt’s house, who generously prepared pizza for all of us and offered to host us for two nights. That concludes our adventures in Appalachia. Stay tuned for more updates!

            <p>Hi all! It’s Dan, with some general additions before I get into our fun weekend in Nashville. The first half of the trip is just Poom and I - Brendan will be joining us in Seattle - he has been contributing with music recs thankfully (we need more! Let us know!) As for this website, it will slowly get better (we have images and links now, woo!) Will I ever fix the fact that you have to click one of the entries on the sidebar for the website to work as intended? Maybe! For those in my family asking to comment - this isn’t social media, but feel free to email/text communicate with us in any way you know us from! You’ll also be getting some numerical updates from me - and eventually a box-score esque table on the end of each post. If you have anything we should count or keep track of, let us know! Always nice to have something to do while driving.
            </p>
            <p> As Poom mentioned, my Aunt graciously hosted us during our stay in Nashville. We slept in while we were there - people who know me know that waking up at 6-7am while we had been camping was going to catch up to me. We were spoiled with great food, people, and my Aunt’s two lovely dogs (although maybe not as spoiled as her dogs, they’re the royalty in that house). We hiked a total of 16.5 miles during our time in Appalachia, with a total elevation gain of 3560 ft. We didn’t slow down though - we did 16,443 steps walking around Nashville, more than any other day except our first day of the trip. 
            </p>
            <p>We started our afternoon in Nashville at their main park, Centennial Park. There was a free concert series happening where we stopped by and heard a few songs from The Watson Twins. Live music is great - even country. The big attraction in Centennial Park is Nashville’s full scale replica of the Parthenon. It is impressive and now home to a small museum we visited with a great exhibit on repatriation - see <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/27/opinion/nashville-museum-artifacts-mexico.html">this NYT article</a>. Small may be the wrong word as on the second floor, occupying the rest of the Parthenon, is a 42 ft replica of the Athena Parthenon. It’s the tallest indoor statue in the western hemisphere, and the small statue of Nike in Athena’s hand is taller than I am at 6 '4". All the Percy Jackson reading as a kid finally paid off I guess. 
            </p>
            <img src = "images/athena.jpg">
            <p>
            We then made our way downtown, walking past Vanderbilt’s under construction athletic facilities on the way - an awful lot of football field construction for a not very good football team. Food wise we had to try the Nashville favorite - hot chicken. We got this spicy, crispier variant of fried chicken at the southern equivalent of Quincy Market for the pvd/Boston folks. Poom was impressed by my spice tolerance, apparently after a year of eating his curry I have developed some ability to eat spicy food. After walking around downtown and Broadway for a bit, we stopped for a milkshake at the Legendary Milkshake Bar - and I was not disappointed. We shared (yes, they’re that big) a cookie dough concoction of epic proportions. 
            </p>
            <p>Although very touristy, we decided to head back to Broadway and go in and out of the bars, listening to all the great live music along the way. Everyone was good - especially the supporting band members - they were definitely some of the best drummers/bassists/etc I had heard live. Most impressive was how long they were on for, as one of the groups was playing about 14 hours of shows within a 24 hour period. We briefly met some people, but it shouldn’t surprise anyone that the only person I was talking to was a photographer. Overall, it was a very fun night, and it was great as always to see my aunt and uncle - now the trip out west begins!
