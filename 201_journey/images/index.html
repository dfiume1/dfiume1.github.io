            <h2>The 201 Journey: Prelude / About this Trip: </h2>
            <p>This summer, my two roommates Brendan, Poom and I have decided to enjoy our fleeting youth and lack of responsibilities by driving to Seattle and back. While I’m not sure exactly when the idea came about, there was a time where we didn’t know if Poom was going to be in the U.S., so we would take the opportunity to see the country together. We’ll largely be camping, as well as staying with friends and family (thank you!!!!). We acknowledge that we’re very privileged to be able to do something like this, and we plan on doing some good along the way. We'll have more to say on this, but for now it is important to note that many of the national parks are unable to sustain their visitors as well as occupying stolen land. From environmental, photographic, and respectful perspectives, we aim to hold ourselves to a higher standard.<p>

            <p>You’ll get updates from us here, as well as some stats, oddities, stories, and some photos along the way. My photography (some digital, some color film) from this trip will be available somewhere at some point, the photos with the blog will likely be shot on iPhone </p>

                FAQ: 
                <br> 
                Why is this website so bad? Don’t you all do some sort of computer science?
                Yes and yes. I made it from scratch the day before we left - it might get better, it might not. Graphic design is our passion.
